## Start Project locally

Make sure that you `cd` into the backend folder before following the setup steps.
Also, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine.

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```bash
  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided.
```bash
$ createdb trivia
$ createdb trivia_test
$ psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

4. Change database config so it can connect to your local postgres database
- Open `config.py` with your editor of choice. 
- Here you can see this dict:
 ```python
 database_setup = {
    "database_name_production" : "trivia",
    "database_name_test" : "trivia_test",
    "user_name" : "postgres", # default postgres user name
    "password" : "mypassword123", # if applicable. If no password, just type in None
    "port" : "localhost:5432" # default postgres port
}
 ```
 - Just change `user_name`, `password` and `port` to whatever you choose while installing postgres.
>_tip_: `user_name` usually defaults to `postgres` and `port` always defaults to `localhost:5432` while installing postgres, most of the time you just need to change the `password`.

5. Run the development server:
  ```bash 
  $ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ flask run
  ```

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

1. (optional) To execute tests, run
```bash 
$ dropdb trivia_test
$ createdb trivia_test
$ psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
$ python test_flaskr.py
```
If you choose to run all tests, it should give this response if everything went fine:
```bash
$ python test_flaskr.py
C:\Python36\lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy\util\langhelpers.py:217: 
  loader = self.auto_fn(name)
......................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 22 tests in 6.748s

OK

## API Documentation

Here you can find all existing endpoints, which methods can be used, how to work with them & example responses youÂ´ll get.

Additionally, common pitfalls & error messages are explained, if applicable.

### Base URL

Since this API is not hosted on a specific domain, it can only be accessed when
`flask` is run locally. To make requests to the API via `curl` or `postman`,
you need to use the default domain on which the flask server is running.

**_http://127.0.0.1:5000/_**

### Available Endpoints

Here is a short table about which ressources exist and which method you can use on them.

                          Allowed Methods
       Endpoints    |  GET |  POST |  DELETE | 
                    |------|-------|---------|
      /questions    |  [x] |  [x]  |   [x]   |         
      /categories   |  [x] |  [x]  |   [x]   |           
      /quizzes      |      |  [x]  |         |
